Each player now uses a rail-bound train (like a persisting minecart) as their central point of operations.
- Trains permanently replace beds for respawn and recall use.
- Trains can only move on rails.
- Trains need fuel to move. More and better fuel increases distance and speed.
- Trains can be extended with cars for upgrades.
