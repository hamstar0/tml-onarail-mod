# On A Rail

Each player now uses a rail-bound train as their main base of operations.
- Trains permanently replace beds for respawn and recall use.
- Trains can only move on rails.
- Trains give +20 defense and move faster than basic minecarts, but lack jump height.
- Train Tunnels may be crafted and placed for quickly getting around underground.

Future features:
- Trains need fuel to move.
- Fast travel options will be added.
- Train upgrades will be added.
